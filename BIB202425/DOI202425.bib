abstract="Evolutionary algorithms are increasingly recognised as a viable computational approach for the automated optimisation of deep neural networks (DNNs) within artificial intelligence. This method extends to the training of DNNs, an approach known as neuroevolution. However, neuroevolution is an inherently resource-intensive process, with certain studies reporting the consumption of thousands of GPU days for refining and training a single DNN network. To address the computational challenges associated with neuroevolution while still attaining good DNN accuracy, surrogate models emerge as a pragmatic solution. Despite their potential, the integration of surrogate models into neuroevolution is still in its early stages, hindered by factors such as the effective use of high-dimensional data and the representation employed in neuroevolution. In this context, we address these challenges by employing a suitable representation based on Linear Genetic Programming, denoted as NeuroLGP, and leveraging Kriging Partial Least Squares. The amalgamation of these two techniques culminates in our proposed methodology known as the NeuroLGP-Surrogate Model (NeuroLGP-SM). For comparison purposes, we also code and use a baseline approach incorporating a repair mechanism, a common practice in neuroevolution. Notably, the baseline approach surpasses the renowned VGG-16 model in accuracy. Given the computational intensity inherent in DNN operations, a singular run is typically the norm. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conducted 96 independent runs spanning a duration of 4 weeks. Significantly, our methodologies consistently outperform the baseline, with the SM model demonstrating superior accuracy or comparable results to the NeuroLGP approach. Noteworthy is the additional advantage that the SM approach exhibits a 25{\$}{\$}{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}{\%}reduction in computational requirements, further emphasising its efficiency for neuroevolution.",

abstract="Dysarthric speech recognition is essential for enhancing communication and accessibility for individuals with speech impairments, yet its development is hindered by a scarcity of robust, speaker-specific datasets. This study explores low-resource dysarthric speech recognition through cross-speaker transfer using synthetic data and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We integrate SpeechT5 text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis with x-vector speaker embeddings to generate speaker-specific dysarthric speech, enabling model adaptation while preserving pathological speech characteristics such as prosodic irregularities. Experiments on the TORGO dataset show that mixed cross-synthetic data with LoRA fine-tuning achieves a WER of 0.17, representing a 71.7{\%} improvement over the standard model (0.60 WER) without fine-tuning the TTS model. However, cross-dataset generalisation remains challenging, yielding higher WERs on MINDS-14 (4.69) and AMI (0.96--3.83) datasets. Whilst synthetic data enhances in-domain recognition, further research is needed to improve cross-dataset generalisation and speaker adaptation, particularly for low-resource pathological speech settings.",

abstract="[Context and motivation] Software requirements are commonly expressed in natural-language, which must be formalised if they are to be used by formal methods such as Runtime Verification (RV), where we verify that an implementation obeys its requirements during execution. [Question/problem] This paper reports on our experience of using the Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET) to formalise requirements for an autonomous tilt-rotor drone in the ProVANT Emergentia research project. Structured, formalised requirements help to refine the meaning of, and discover ambiguities in, a requirements set, which is beneficial for safety-critical systems. FRET generates a temporal logic semantics for each requirement, providing formulas that can be used for RV. [Principal ideas/results] We describe the process of formalising the natural-language requirements using FRET. We present the progress made in each of the four versions of the requirements set as new information was elicited and incorporated. Our two concrete outputs are the formalised requirement set, which we will use in our ongoing development and verification of ProVANT; and metrics about the requirements. [Contribution] From our experience, we present guidance for requirements elicitation and formalisation with FRET. We highlight situations where it was difficult to formalise these requirements and describe potential improvements to FRET to address these difficulties.",
