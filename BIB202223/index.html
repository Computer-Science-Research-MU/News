  <h1>MU CS Research activities  2022-10-01 to 2023-09-30</h1>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p align="justify">
  MU CS Department published 50+ publications in top journals and conferences venues during this 2022-23 reporting period. 
  The department has several areas of excellence, notably for the period, in Theoretical Computer Science, Evolutionary Computation, Signal Processing, 
  Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Science Education and Remote Sensing.      
</p>
 
<p align="justify">
During the period, <a href="https://research.cs.nuim.ie/MUCSprojects.html" target="_blank">2M€+ was awarded to the department in research funding</a> from several funding agencies (IRC, SFI, EPA). 
The MU CS department is also well represented as part of SFI research centres (LERO, ADAPT, IFORM, CLIMATE+). 
</p>
 
<p align="justify">
The CS department is also very engaged in a variety of outreach activities supporting computer science education in Ireland. 
For instance, the CS MU department organizes <a href="https://maynoothuniversity.ie/computer-science/summer-camps" target="_blank">beginner and advanced summer camps</a> cater for students aged 13-18 years old that include Women-in-STEM week. The CS department PACT team has run continuing professional development workshops on computational thinking for primary and secondary school teachers. 

</p> 
<p align="justify">
The SFI funded project <a href="https://copilotai.ie/" target="_blank">copilotai.ie</a>  has won the SFI-Defense Innovation Challenge prize 
(see <a href="https://www.sfi.ie/research-news/news/deforg-tanaiste-minister/" target="_blank">press release Tánaiste and Minister reveal million-euro idea in SFI-Defence Organisation Innovation Challenge</a>). 
This project aims at developing a tactical decision-support system, using the latest Artificial Intelligence technologies for managing Wildfires.
