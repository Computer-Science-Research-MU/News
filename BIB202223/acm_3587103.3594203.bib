abstract = {In this poster, we highlight computational thinking resources for schools from the PACT team at Maynooth University, Ireland. The resources are derived from tasks from the Bebras international computational thinking initiative. The different modalities work together throughout the school year to provide initial exposure to computational thinking, and include an obstacle course, seasonal tasks, and a workbook.},
