abstract = {This paper describes an unplugged computational thinking (CT) resource for primary and secondary schools developed from Bebras tasks. In Ireland, CT is not part of the primary school curriculum or mandatory in secondary schools. However, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is in the process of revising the primary school curriculum to include aspects of CT. Our aim for creating this CT Obstacle Course is to introduce teachers (and pupils) without formal computer science training to the subject of CT. This is done in a manner that informs and motivates, and gives them the confidence to deliver CT materials in the classroom. We also want to find out from teachers how useful and important this type of resource is for developing problem-solving skills, and if our unplugged activity can support learning at various skill levels. Our CT Obstacle Course includes 14 Bebras tasks for primary schools and an additional 6 Bebras tasks for secondary schools. The activity is suitable for indoors and outdoors and is completed in groups, promoting teamwork and communication. We have delivered it to 146 primary school classes during 38 school visits between May 2021 and June 2022. It has been undertaken by 3,445 pupils and 195 teachers and other school staff. This paper describes our CT resource in detail, and reports teacher feedback from primary schools.},
