abstract={Collaborative learning is an advantageous pedagogical strategy to include in e-learning. In this study we aim to demonstrate a methodology created to implement this strategy in an undergraduate student population. We will present our findings from running this experiment in two scenarios, namely an in-person environment and a simulated remote environment. We analyse the impact this methodology has on students understanding of the topic along with how their assessment compares to their peers in a previous year. We also analyse the different perception of personal and collaborative work in both scenarios. We conclude that this methodology is effective in increasing a student's understanding of the work being assessed and contributes to an increase in students' assessment grades.},
