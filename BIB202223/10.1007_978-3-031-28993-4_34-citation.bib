abstract="We explore a new conceptual framework for interaction design in the context of ubiquitous musical activities, banging interaction. Our proposal entails a shift of focus from instruments, tools or device-oriented approaches to a timbre-led design practice that targets the potential relationships between sonic and multimodal qualities and the local available technological resources. One thread of this perspective envisages more flexible usage through the application of adaptive techniques. Another thread engages with recent advances in mid-air interaction, hinting at multimodal sensing. Yet another thread involves the incorporation of an aesthetically pliable approach to sonic materials, materialised through timbre as a target, rather than `notes', `instruments' or `orchestras'. We present two examples of deployments: The prototype mixDroid, one of the first systems to employ mobile devices in everyday settings for creative purposes, and the prototype Dynamic Drum Collective, an adaptive implementation for percussive sources based on visual tokens and whole-body interaction.",
