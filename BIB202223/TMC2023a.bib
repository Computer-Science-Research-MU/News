abstract={Global research is showing that coastal blue carbon ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change driven threats including accelerated sea-level rise and prolonged periods of drought. Furthermore, direct anthropogenic impacts present immediate threats through deterioration of coastal water quality, land reclamation, long-term impact to sediment biogeochemical cycling. These threats will invariably alter the future efficacy of carbon (C) sequestration processes and it is imperative that currently existing blue carbon habitats be protected. Knowledge of underlying biogeochemical, physical and hydrological interactions occurring in functioning blue carbon habitats is essential for developing strategies to mitigate threats, and promote conditions to optimise C sequestration/storage. In this current work, we investigated how sediment geochemistry (0–10 cm depth) responds to elevation, an edaphic factor driven by long-term hydrological regimes consequently exerting control over particle sedimentation rates and vegetation succession. },
