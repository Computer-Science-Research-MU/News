  abstract={This system mainly studies the development and application of autonomous driving simulation platform based on virtual reality (VR) technology. A digital twin vehicle platooning simulation system (DTVPSS) is proposed. Digital twin and vehicle platooning (VP) are both concepts that have been proposed. However, developing a complete virtual platform for vehicle queues, with interactive control between the virtual and physical worlds, has rarely been explored. In order to solve this problem, This paper digital twin technology is innovative applied to vehicle queue simulation platform. Digital twin and VR technology build highly simulated and reliable systems. The innovation point of the system is to realize the following of vehicles and form the autonomous driving of car formation by considering the collaborative planning technical scheme between vehicles. The system makes the VP no longer only controlled by hardware, increases the software operability of the VP, and provides a more real, convenient and economical virtual simulation platform with low delay.},
