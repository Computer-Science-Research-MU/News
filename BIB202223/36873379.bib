abstract={Coastal wetlands are highly efficient 'blue carbon' sinks which contribute to mitigating climate change through the long-term removal of atmospheric CO2 and capture of carbon (C). Microorganisms are integral to C sequestration in blue carbon sediments and face a myriad of natural and anthropogenic pressures yet their adaptive responses are poorly understood. One such response in bacteria is the alteration of biomass lipids, specifically through the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and alteration of membrane phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). PHAs are highly reduced bacterial storage polymers that increase bacterial fitness in changing environments. In this study, we investigated the distribution of microbial PHA, PLFA profiles, community structure and response to changes in sediment geochemistry along an elevation gradient from intertidal to vegetated supratidal sediments. We found highest PHA accumulation, monomer diversity and expression of lipid stress indices in elevated and vegetated sediments where C, nitrogen (N), PAH and heavy metals increased, and pH was significantly lower. This was accompanied by a reduction in bacterial diversity and a shift to higher abundances of microbial community members favouring complex C degradation. Results presented here describe a connection between bacterial PHA accumulation, membrane lipid adaptation, microbial community composition and polluted C rich sediments.},
