abstract="We explore a new conceptual framework for interaction design in the context of ubiquitous musical activities, banging interaction. Our proposal entails a shift of focus from instruments, tools or device-oriented approaches to a timbre-led design practice that targets the potential relationships between sonic and multimodal qualities and the local available technological resources. One thread of this perspective envisages more flexible usage through the application of adaptive techniques. Another thread engages with recent advances in mid-air interaction, hinting at multimodal sensing. Yet another thread involves the incorporation of an aesthetically pliable approach to sonic materials, materialised through timbre as a target, rather than `notes', `instruments' or `orchestras'. We present two examples of deployments: The prototype mixDroid, one of the first systems to employ mobile devices in everyday settings for creative purposes, and the prototype Dynamic Drum Collective, an adaptive implementation for percussive sources based on visual tokens and whole-body interaction.",

abstract="This ``journal-first'' paper summarises a publication by the same authors in the journal Logical Methods in Computer Science which describes a formal semantics for the Event-B specification language using the theory of institutions. It defines an institution for Event-B and shows how the constructs of the Event-B specification language can be mapped into our institution. This algebraic semantics distinguishes three constituent sub-languages of Event-B: the superstructure, infrastructure and mathematical languages. An important impact of this work is that our semantics provides access to the generic modularisation constructs available in institutions, including specification-building operators for parameterisation and refinement. We demonstrate how these features subsume and enhance the corresponding features already present in Event-B through a detailed study of their use in a worked example. Further benefits of the institutional approach are its provision for mathematically definable interoperability to facilitate heterogeneous specification.",

abstract="Third-wave HCI broadens technology from traditional settings to everyday life. This wave has also influenced the internet of musical things (IoMusT) and ubiquitous music (ubimus), and these fields are inspired by the idea of including everyday things to act as musical things and become part of the push for ubiquitous computing for musical activities. This multiplies the possibilities in which musical interactions can occur and thus allows participants with various levels of musical experience to engage in musical activities. The interface design that not only supports musical activities but also delivers the experience of the musical activity is a challenging task for IoMusT. This paper presents a gesture-based timbre-led musical interface designed for casual musical activities. Earlier studies with this interface have shown the social aspect of interpersonal interactions in a musical activity. As music has a social role when individuals are connected in a musical activity, it is vital to understand the patterns of these interpersonal interactions. Here, we present a qualitative study that explores this social bond and how individuals perceive their own abilities and participation during such activities. The individual and dyadic musical interactions were structured into two steps and the results are explained to discuss the dimensions of this interaction.",

abstract = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) aim to use efficient computational models with the goal of approximating the fitness function in evolutionary computation systems. This area of research has received significant attention from the specialised research community in different areas, for example, single and many objective optimisation or dynamic and stationary optimisation problems. An emergent and exciting area that has received little attention from the SAEAs community is in neuroevolution. This refers to the use of evolutionary algorithms in the automatic configuration of artificial neural network (ANN) architectures, hyper-parameters and/or the training of ANNs. However, ANNs suffer from two major issues: (a) the use of highly-intense computational power for their correct training, and (b) the highly specialised human expertise required to correctly configure ANNs necessary to get a well-performing network. This work aims to fill this important research gap in SAEAs in neuroevolution by addressing these two issues. We demonstrate how one can use a Kriging Partial Least Squares method in place of the well-known Kriging method, which normally cannot be used in neuroevolution due to the high dimensionality of the data.},

In Ireland, CT is not part of the primary school curriculum or mandatory in secondary schools. However, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is in the process of revising the primary school curriculum to include aspects of CT. Our aim for creating this CT Obstacle Course is to introduce teachers (and pupils) without formal computer science training to the subject of CT. This is done in a manner that informs and motivates, and gives them the confidence to deliver CT materials in the classroom. We also want to find out from teachers how useful and important this type of resource is for developing problem-solving skills, and if our unplugged activity can support learning at various skill levels. Our CT Obstacle Course includes 14 Bebras tasks for primary schools and an additional 6 Bebras tasks for secondary schools. The activity is suitable for indoors and outdoors and is completed in groups, promoting teamwork and communication. We have delivered it to 146 primary school classes during 38 school visits between May 2021 and June 2022. It has been undertaken by 3,445 pupils and 195 teachers and other school staff. This paper describes our CT resource in detail, and reports teacher feedback from primary schools.},

ABSTRACT = {We introduce a new perspective for musical interaction tailored to a specific class of sonic resources: impact sounds. Our work is informed by the field of ubiquitous music (ubimus) and engages with the demands of artistic practices. Through a series of deployments of a low-cost and highly flexible network-based prototype, the Dynamic Drum Collective, we exemplify the limitations and specific contributions of banging interaction. Three components of this new design strategy—adaptive interaction, mid-air techniques and timbre-led design—target the development of creative-action metaphors that make use of resources available in everyday settings. The techniques involving the use of sonic gridworks yielded positive outcomes. The subjects tended to choose sonic materials that—when combined with their actions on the prototype—approached a full rendition of the proposed soundtrack. The results of the study highlighted the subjects’ reliance on visual feedback as a non-exclusive strategy to handle both temporal organization and collaboration. The results show a methodological shift from device-centric and instrumental-centric methods to designs that target the dynamic relational properties of ubimus ecosystems.},

ABSTRACT = {Software verification is an important approach to establishing the reliability of critical systems. One important area of application is in the field of robotics, as robots take on more tasks in both day-to-day areas and highly specialised domains. Our particular interest is in checking the plans that robots are expected to follow to detect errors that would lead to unreliable behaviour. Python is a popular programming language in the robotics domain through the use of the Robot Operating System (ROS) and various other libraries. Python’s Turtle package provides a mobile agent, which we formally model here using Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). Our interactive toolchain CSP2Turtle with CSP models and Python components enables plans for the turtle agent to be verified using the FDR model-checker before being executed in Python. This means that certain classes of errors can be avoided, providing a starting point for more detailed verification of Turtle programs and more complex robotic systems. We illustrate our approach with examples of robot navigation and obstacle avoidance in a 2D grid-world. We evaluate our approach and discuss future work, including how our approach could be scaled to larger systems.},

abstract  ="Broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (BCARS) is capable of producing high-quality Raman spectra spanning broad bandwidths{,} 400–4000 cm−1{,} with millisecond acquisition times. Raw BCARS spectra{,} however{,} are a coherent combination of vibrationally resonant (Raman) and non-resonant (electronic) components that may challenge or degrade chemical analyses. Recently{,} we demonstrated a deep convolutional autoencoder network{,} trained on pairs of simulated BCARS-Raman datasets{,} which could retrieve the Raman signal with high quality under ideal conditions. In this work{,} we present a new computational system that incorporates experimental measurements of the laser system spectral and temporal properties{,} combined with simulated susceptibilities. Thus{,} the neural network learns the mapping between the susceptibility and the measured response for a specific BCARS system. The network is tested on simulated and measured experimental results taken with our BCARS system."}

abstract = {We repeat the derivation of the forces of a single-beam gradient laser trap on a dielectric sphere in the ray optics regime as first reported by Ashkin; in this case, however, we investigate the impact of partial absorption of light by the sphere on these trapping forces. Our model indicates that the effect of absorption is to reduce the axial and transverse trapping forces as a function of absorption, as well as changing the axial trap position. The trap stiffness is predicted to remain relatively unchanged even for high levels of absorption. The model also predicts that a rotational force is imparted on the sphere as a consequence of absorption. The torque associated with a single ray is first derived, which is shown to increase as a function of both absorption, radius, and the angle of incidence. This enables a derivation of the torque acting on a trapped sphere as it is laterally displaced from the trapping position, which is found to increase linearly with respect to the transverse displacement of the sphere. The torque is derived to be zero for the case of no absorption, and also for the case of axial displacement of the sphere, regardless of absorption. The model reduces exactly to Ashkin's model for the case of zero absorption.}

abstract = {Formal verification of a UML class diagram annotated with OCL constraints has been a long-standing challenge in Model-driven Engineering. In the past decades, many tools and techniques have been proposed to tackle this challenge. However, they do not scale well and are often unable to locate the conflicts when then number of OCL constraints significantly increases. In this paper, we present a new tool called QMaxUSE. This tool is designed for verifying UML class diagrams annotated with large number of OCL invariants. QMaxUSE is easy to install and deploy. It offers two distinct features. (1) A simple query language that allows users to choose parts of a UML class diagram to be verified. (2) A new procedure that is capable of performing concurrent verification.}

TITLE = {The Role of Artificial Intelligence within Circular Economy Activities—A View from Ireland},

ABSTRACT = {The world’s current linear economic model is unsustainable. This model encourages improper use of limited natural resources and causes abundant waste production resulting in severe harm to the environment. A circular economy (CE) is a sustainable, restorative, and regenerative alternative to the current linear economy and is gaining popularity worldwide. Amongst various digital technologies, Artificial intelligence (AI) is a crucial enabler for CE and can aid significantly with the adoption and implementation of CE in real-world applications. In this paper, we describe the intersection of AI and CE and policies around implementing CE principles using AI. As a means of grounding the discussion, we discuss some initiatives taken by the Irish government to adopt circularity and explore the role AI plays in these. We present a number of practical examples of AI and CE from Ireland. We argue that digitalisation has potential in CE and it has a major role to play in the transition towards CE. We close the paper by reflecting on future steps around practical implementations of AI-based CE processes.},
