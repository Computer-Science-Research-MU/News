ABSTRACT = {The world’s current linear economic model is unsustainable. This model encourages improper use of limited natural resources and causes abundant waste production resulting in severe harm to the environment. A circular economy (CE) is a sustainable, restorative, and regenerative alternative to the current linear economy and is gaining popularity worldwide. Amongst various digital technologies, Artificial intelligence (AI) is a crucial enabler for CE and can aid significantly with the adoption and implementation of CE in real-world applications. In this paper, we describe the intersection of AI and CE and policies around implementing CE principles using AI. As a means of grounding the discussion, we discuss some initiatives taken by the Irish government to adopt circularity and explore the role AI plays in these. We present a number of practical examples of AI and CE from Ireland. We argue that digitalisation has potential in CE and it has a major role to play in the transition towards CE. We close the paper by reflecting on future steps around practical implementations of AI-based CE processes.},
