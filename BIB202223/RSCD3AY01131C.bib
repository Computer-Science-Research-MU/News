abstract  ="Broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (BCARS) is capable of producing high-quality Raman spectra spanning broad bandwidths{,} 400–4000 cm−1{,} with millisecond acquisition times. Raw BCARS spectra{,} however{,} are a coherent combination of vibrationally resonant (Raman) and non-resonant (electronic) components that may challenge or degrade chemical analyses. Recently{,} we demonstrated a deep convolutional autoencoder network{,} trained on pairs of simulated BCARS-Raman datasets{,} which could retrieve the Raman signal with high quality under ideal conditions. In this work{,} we present a new computational system that incorporates experimental measurements of the laser system spectral and temporal properties{,} combined with simulated susceptibilities. Thus{,} the neural network learns the mapping between the susceptibility and the measured response for a specific BCARS system. The network is tested on simulated and measured experimental results taken with our BCARS system."}
