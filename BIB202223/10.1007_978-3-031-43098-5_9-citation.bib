abstract="Machine vision has produced many helpful image processing techniques in several fields, such as object detection, classification, and segmentation. Machine vision is an interdisciplinary field that combines methods from computer vision and machine learning, mainly deep learning to solve issues. Common issues, such as classification and localisation, are typical examples that combine these research fields. These techniques have many applications in entomology. In the entomological context, classification methods identify insect species or features of an insect, and localisation methods return their position within a scene. The available techniques for localisation and classification benefit the entomological community by assisting specialists. This chapter introduces the application of machine vision methods to identify and localise insects and the features of their anatomy. The machine vision pipeline, image descriptors, and fundamental methods, such as thresholding, blob, and contour detection, are presented. Deep Learning (DL) methods are applied for insect classification, focusing on Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including concepts of transfer learning applied to insect classification. A dataset of medically and forensically important flies, Diptera, is used to illustrate these methods. CNN-based methods are described for insect localisation, and semantic segmentation using the U-Net architecture trained on the dataset of flies is presented. The dimensional reduction method PaCMAP is applied to visualise the feature extracted from the fly datasets. The Grad-CAM method is used on the flies datasets to assist insect object localisation. Finally, different platforms of computing are presented and compared under three different metrics of performance, power consumption, and operating temperature.",
