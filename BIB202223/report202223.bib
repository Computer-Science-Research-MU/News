abstract  =  {Deep learning based pipelines for semantic segmentation often ignore structural information available 
on annotated images used for training. We propose a novel post-processing module enforcing structural knowledge about
 the objects of interest to improve segmentation results provided by deep neural networks (DNNs). This module corresponds
  to a “many-to-one-or-none” inexact graph matching approach, and is formulated as a quadratic assignment problem.
   Our approach is compared to a DNN-based segmentation on two public datasets, one for face segmentation from 2D RGB images
    (FASSEG), and the other for brain segmentation from 3D MRIs (IBSR). Evaluations are performed using two types of structural information: 
    distances and directional relations that are user defined, this choice being a hyper-parameter of our proposed generic framework. 
    On FASSEG data, results show that our module improves accuracy of the DNN by about 6.3\% 
    i.e. the Hausdorff distance (HD) decreases from 22.11 to 20.71 on average. With IBSR data, the improvement is of 51\% 
    better accuracy with HD decreasing from 11.01 to 5.4. Finally, our approach is shown to be resilient to small training 
    datasets that often limit the performance of deep learning methods: the improvement increases as the size of the training dataset decreases.}

abstract="We explore a new conceptual framework for interaction design in the context of ubiquitous musical activities, banging interaction. Our proposal entails a shift of focus from instruments, tools or device-oriented approaches to a timbre-led design practice that targets the potential relationships between sonic and multimodal qualities and the local available technological resources. One thread of this perspective envisages more flexible usage through the application of adaptive techniques. Another thread engages with recent advances in mid-air interaction, hinting at multimodal sensing. Yet another thread involves the incorporation of an aesthetically pliable approach to sonic materials, materialised through timbre as a target, rather than `notes', `instruments' or `orchestras'. We present two examples of deployments: The prototype mixDroid, one of the first systems to employ mobile devices in everyday settings for creative purposes, and the prototype Dynamic Drum Collective, an adaptive implementation for percussive sources based on visual tokens and whole-body interaction.",

abstract="Machine vision has produced many helpful image processing techniques in several fields, such as object detection, classification, and segmentation. Machine vision is an interdisciplinary field that combines methods from computer vision and machine learning, mainly deep learning to solve issues. Common issues, such as classification and localisation, are typical examples that combine these research fields. These techniques have many applications in entomology. In the entomological context, classification methods identify insect species or features of an insect, and localisation methods return their position within a scene. The available techniques for localisation and classification benefit the entomological community by assisting specialists. This chapter introduces the application of machine vision methods to identify and localise insects and the features of their anatomy. The machine vision pipeline, image descriptors, and fundamental methods, such as thresholding, blob, and contour detection, are presented. Deep Learning (DL) methods are applied for insect classification, focusing on Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including concepts of transfer learning applied to insect classification. A dataset of medically and forensically important flies, Diptera, is used to illustrate these methods. CNN-based methods are described for insect localisation, and semantic segmentation using the U-Net architecture trained on the dataset of flies is presented. The dimensional reduction method PaCMAP is applied to visualise the feature extracted from the fly datasets. The Grad-CAM method is used on the flies datasets to assist insect object localisation. Finally, different platforms of computing are presented and compared under three different metrics of performance, power consumption, and operating temperature.",

abstract="Third-wave HCI broadens technology from traditional settings to everyday life. This wave has also influenced the internet of musical things (IoMusT) and ubiquitous music (ubimus), and these fields are inspired by the idea of including everyday things to act as musical things and become part of the push for ubiquitous computing for musical activities. This multiplies the possibilities in which musical interactions can occur and thus allows participants with various levels of musical experience to engage in musical activities. The interface design that not only supports musical activities but also delivers the experience of the musical activity is a challenging task for IoMusT. This paper presents a gesture-based timbre-led musical interface designed for casual musical activities. Earlier studies with this interface have shown the social aspect of interpersonal interactions in a musical activity. As music has a social role when individuals are connected in a musical activity, it is vital to understand the patterns of these interpersonal interactions. Here, we present a qualitative study that explores this social bond and how individuals perceive their own abilities and participation during such activities. The individual and dyadic musical interactions were structured into two steps and the results are explained to discuss the dimensions of this interaction.",

abstract={The proliferation of online eHealth has made it much easier for users to access healthcare services and interventions from the comfort of their own homes. This study looks at how well one such platform—eSano—performs in terms of user experience when delivering mindfulness interventions. In order to assess usability and user experience, several tools such as eye-tracking technology, think-aloud sessions, a system usability scale questionnaire, an application questionnaire, and post-experiment interviews were employed. Participants were evaluated while they accessed the first module of the mindfulness intervention provided by eSano to measure their interaction with the app, and their level of engagement, and to obtain feedback on both the intervention and its overall usability. The results revealed that although users generally rated their experience with the app positively in terms of overall satisfaction, according to data collected through the system usability scale questionnaire, participants rated the first module of the mindfulness intervention as below average. Additionally, eye-tracking data showed that some users skipped long text blocks in favor of answering questions quickly while others spent more than half their time reading them. Henceforth, recommendations were put forward to improve both the usability and persuasiveness of the app—such as incorporating shorter text blocks and more engaging interactive elements—in order to raise adherence rates. Overall findings from this study provide valuable insights into how users interact with the eSano's participant app which can be used as guidelines for the future development of more effective and user-friendly platforms. Moreover, considering these potential improvements will help foster more positive experiences that promote regular engagement with these types of apps; taking into account emotional states and needs that vary across different age groups and abilities.},

abstract={Coastal wetlands are highly efficient 'blue carbon' sinks which contribute to mitigating climate change through the long-term removal of atmospheric CO2 and capture of carbon (C). Microorganisms are integral to C sequestration in blue carbon sediments and face a myriad of natural and anthropogenic pressures yet their adaptive responses are poorly understood. One such response in bacteria is the alteration of biomass lipids, specifically through the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and alteration of membrane phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). PHAs are highly reduced bacterial storage polymers that increase bacterial fitness in changing environments. In this study, we investigated the distribution of microbial PHA, PLFA profiles, community structure and response to changes in sediment geochemistry along an elevation gradient from intertidal to vegetated supratidal sediments. We found highest PHA accumulation, monomer diversity and expression of lipid stress indices in elevated and vegetated sediments where C, nitrogen (N), PAH and heavy metals increased, and pH was significantly lower. This was accompanied by a reduction in bacterial diversity and a shift to higher abundances of microbial community members favouring complex C degradation. Results presented here describe a connection between bacterial PHA accumulation, membrane lipid adaptation, microbial community composition and polluted C rich sediments.},

  abstract={While there are many purely software-based solutions available for live head pose tracking, the same is not true for gaze
estimation which is usually done using specialised hardware; typically, eye-trackers that use infrared light sources and
special camera. The challenge when using vision-based Machine Learning methods to estimate gaze from an image of a
user is that the features of a user's eyes that vary with gaze position are small and difficult to track. This paper describes
a classification-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system that can, from images of a user's face, estimate where
on a screen they are looking in real time. Labelled images of an individual looking at specified regions of a screen were
collected, and these images were used to train a Deep Learning model. The final model trained was found to be accurate
enough to correctly guess which section of the screen (3x3 grid) the user is looking in over 99% of the time. The current
system requires strict input conditions on head orientation, a limitation on the system. The integration of head pose
estimation and methods of improving resolution are discussed. The approach uses two classifiers, one for horizontal gaze
(3 regions) and another for vertical gaze (3 regions) combined to estimate gaze location. This approach was found to be
more effective than a single classifier for nine separate regions. Using both eyes, excluding the nose region and other
facial features of the input images also improved performance.},

abstract = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) aim to use efficient computational models with the goal of approximating the fitness function in evolutionary computation systems. This area of research has received significant attention from the specialised research community in different areas, for example, single and many objective optimisation or dynamic and stationary optimisation problems. An emergent and exciting area that has received little attention from the SAEAs community is in neuroevolution. This refers to the use of evolutionary algorithms in the automatic configuration of artificial neural network (ANN) architectures, hyper-parameters and/or the training of ANNs. However, ANNs suffer from two major issues: (a) the use of highly-intense computational power for their correct training, and (b) the highly specialised human expertise required to correctly configure ANNs necessary to get a well-performing network. This work aims to fill this important research gap in SAEAs in neuroevolution by addressing these two issues. We demonstrate how one can use a Kriging Partial Least Squares method in place of the well-known Kriging method, which normally cannot be used in neuroevolution due to the high dimensionality of the data.},

Our aim for creating this CT Obstacle Course is to introduce teachers (and pupils) without formal computer science training to the subject of CT. This is done in a manner that informs and motivates, and gives them the confidence to deliver CT materials in the classroom. We also want to find out from teachers how useful and important this type of resource is for developing problem-solving skills, and if our unplugged activity can support learning at various skill levels. Our CT Obstacle Course includes 14 Bebras tasks for primary schools and an additional 6 Bebras tasks for secondary schools. The activity is suitable for indoors and outdoors and is completed in groups, promoting teamwork and communication. We have delivered it to 146 primary school classes during 38 school visits between May 2021 and June 2022. It has been undertaken by 3,445 pupils and 195 teachers and other school staff.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence in education has the potential to transform the educational landscape and influence the role of the involved stakeholders. With recent European Commission publications on the use of artificial intelligence and data in education and training, in addition to the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and the forthcoming AI act, there is now a precedent that using AI, in and for education, needs to be more trustworthy (transparent and explainable) to be considered for adoption. This paper further develops an AIEd model (PreSS - Predicting Student Success) that has been developed, validated and re-validated over almost two decades, focusing on explainability and transparency. PreSS aims to identify students who are at risk of failing or dropping out of introductory programming courses. This paper presents our recent work to describe PreSS in the context of a trustworthy model, that is both explainable and transparent. First, for explainability, we present Explainable AI (XAI) approaches to describe how predictions are made, and what set of inputs leads to such decisions, which has not been presented before for PreSS. Second, to examine transparency, we present confusion metrics, focusing first on predicting the performance of all students and then on performance at sub-group level such as by gender and age. Finally, we present a model card illustrating where the model performs well and where it does not. All of these steps provide an evolution towards trustworthy educational AI.},

      abstract={The key factor currently limiting the advancement of computational power of electronic computation is no longer the manufacturing density and speed of components, but rather their high energy consumption. While it has been widely argued that reversible computation can escape the fundamental Landauer limit of kBTln(2) Joules per irreversible computational step, there is disagreement around whether indefinitely reusable computation can be achieved without energy dissipation. Here we focus on the relatively simpler context of sampling problems, which take no input, so avoids modeling the energy costs of the observer perturbing the machine to change its input. Given an algorithm A for generating samples from a distribution, we desire a device that can perpetually generate samples from that distribution driven entirely by Brownian motion. We show that such a device can efficiently execute algorithm A in the sense that we must wait only O(time(A)2) between samples. We consider two output models: Las Vegas, which samples from the exact probability distribution every 4 tries in expectation, and Monte Carlo, in which every try succeeds but the distribution is only approximated. We base our model on continuous-time random walks over the state space graph of a general computational machine, with a space-bounded Turing machine as one instantiation. The problem of sampling a computationally complex probability distribution with no energy dissipation informs our understanding of the energy requirements of computation, and may lead to more energy efficient randomized algorithms.},

   abstract={Extensive research on formal verification of machine learning (ML) systems indicates that learning from data alone often fails to capture underlying background knowledge. A variety of verifiers have been developed to ensure that a machine-learnt model satisfies correctness and safety properties, however, these verifiers typically assume a trained network with fixed weights. ML-enabled autonomous systems are required to not only detect incorrect predictions, but should also possess the ability to self-correct, continuously improving and adapting. A promising approach for creating ML models that inherently satisfy constraints is to encode background knowledge as logical constraints that guide the learning process via so-called differentiable logics. In this research preview, we compare and evaluate various logics from the literature in weakly-supervised contexts, presenting our findings and highlighting open problems for future work. Our experimental results are broadly consistent with results reported previously in literature; however, learning with differentiable logics introduces a new hyperparameter that is difficult to tune and has significant influence on the effectiveness of the logics.},

ABSTRACT = {We introduce a new perspective for musical interaction tailored to a specific class of sonic resources: impact sounds. Our work is informed by the field of ubiquitous music (ubimus) and engages with the demands of artistic practices. Through a series of deployments of a low-cost and highly flexible network-based prototype, the Dynamic Drum Collective, we exemplify the limitations and specific contributions of banging interaction. Three components of this new design strategy—adaptive interaction, mid-air techniques and timbre-led design—target the development of creative-action metaphors that make use of resources available in everyday settings. The techniques involving the use of sonic gridworks yielded positive outcomes. The subjects tended to choose sonic materials that—when combined with their actions on the prototype—approached a full rendition of the proposed soundtrack. The results of the study highlighted the subjects’ reliance on visual feedback as a non-exclusive strategy to handle both temporal organization and collaboration. The results show a methodological shift from device-centric and instrumental-centric methods to designs that target the dynamic relational properties of ubimus ecosystems.},

Challenging to summarize, podcasts cover a diverse range of topics, vary in length, and

concise dialogue summaries. In contrast, we propose a method to generate long fine-grained summaries, which describe details of 
sub-topic narratives. Leveraging a readability formula, we curate a data subset to train a long sequence transformer for abstractive summarization.
Through text segmentation, we filter the evaluation data and exclude specific segments of text. 
We apply the model to segmented data, producing different types of fine grained summaries. We show that appropriate filtering 
creates comparable results on ROUGE and serves as an alternative method to truncation. Experiments show our model outperforms 
previous studies on the Spotify podcast dataset when tasked with generating longer sequences of text.},

  abstract={Recent advances in vehicular technologies illuminate the significance of vehicular networking, where information dissemination between constituent network elements plays a crucial role. Information sharing in vehicular networks is challenging because mobility introduces a dynamic environment with overwhelming data traffic. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) reduces overheads by in-network caching and name-oriented communication to mitigate these challenges. However, network resources can be used more efficiently if both RSUs and vehicles are managed autonomously. This article proposes autonomous networking to improve information dissemination in vehicular ICN by using available in-network contextual information. First, a Segment-aware ICN (SA-ICN) scheme is proposed by developing a new dynamic namespace convention. Then, we extend SA-ICN by proposing a Segment and Provider-aware Gossiping enabled ICN (SPG-ICN) that leverages a gossip protocol to self-configure and self-optimize the network using content providers. The simulation results demonstrate performance improvements compared to existing content dissemination schemes regarding packet overheads, data delivery delay, and network load.},

In order to solve this problem, This paper digital twin technology is innovative applied to vehicle queue simulation platform. Digital twin and VR technology build highly simulated and reliable systems. The innovation point of the system is to realize the following of vehicles and form the autonomous driving of car formation by considering the collaborative planning technical scheme between vehicles.

Therefore, we propose a query based summarization approach, to produce audio clip summaries from podcast data. 
Leveraging unsupervised clustering methods, we apply our framework to the Spotify podcasts dataset.
Audio signals are transformed into acoustic word embeddings, along with a pre-selected candidate query.
We initiate the cluster centroids with the query vector and obtain the final snippets by computing a global and local similarity score. 
Additionally, we apply our framework to the AMI meeting dataset and demonstrate how audio can successfully be utilized to perform summarization.},

        the performance differences between just-in-time compiled code and interpretive execution. It provides a contemporary assessment of the interpretive JVM core, the entry and starting point for bytecode execution, relative to just-in-time tiered execution. The study considers factors such as the JRE version, the GNU GCC version used in the JRE build toolchain, and the garbage collector algorithm specified at runtime, and their impact on the performance difference envelope between interpretive and tiered execution. Our findings indicate that tiered execution is considerably more efficient than interpretive execution, and the performance gap has increased, ranging from 4 to 37 times more efficient. On average, tiered execution is approximately 15 times more efficient than interpretive execution. Additionally, the performance differences between interpretive and tiered execution are influenced by workload category, with narrower performance differences observed for web-based workloads and more significant differences for Functional and Scala-type workloads.},

abstract = {Abstract Data derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) are widely employed to predict soil properties, particularly soil moisture and soil carbon content. However, few studies address the use of microwave sensors for soil texture retrieval and those that do are typically constrained to bare soil conditions. Here, we test two statistical modelling approaches—linear (with and without interaction terms) and tree-based models, namely compositional linear regression model (LRM) and random forest (RF)—and both nongeophysical (e.g., surface soil moisture, topographic, etc) and geophysical-based (electromagnetic, magnetic and radiometric) covariates to estimate soil texture (sand \%, silt \% and clay \%), using microwave remote sensing data (ESA Sentinel-1). The statistical models evaluated explicitly consider the compositional nature of soil texture and were evaluated with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Our findings indicate that both modelling approaches yielded better estimates when fitted without the geophysical covariates. Based on the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), LRM slightly outperformed RF, with NSE values for sand, silt and clay of 0.94, 0.62 and 0.46, respectively; for RF, the NSE values were 0.93, 0.59 and 0.44. When interaction terms were included, RF was found to outperform LRM. The inclusion of interactions in the LRM resulted in a decrease in NSE value and an increase in the size of the residuals. Findings also indicate that the use of radar-derived variables (e.g., VV, VH, RVI) alone was not able to predict soil particle size without the aid of other covariates. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly considering the compositional nature of soil texture information in statistical analysis and regression modelling. As part of the continued assessment of microwave remote sensing data (e.g., ESA Sentinel-1) for predicting topsoil particle size, we intend to test surface scattering information derived from the dual-polarimetric decomposition technique and integrate that predictor into the models in order to deal with the effects of vegetation cover on topsoil backscattering.},

The current studies provide bounded investigations of AI-driven CE exclusively in Pakistan. The main purpose of this paper is to elaborate on AI support in the implementation of CE practices and to explore the current waste situation in Pakistan and the implementations of CE and AI-driven CE practices in it. Inductive research is conducted in two stages. On the one hand, the theory is developed to evaluate the CE concept and AI techniques to strengthen its practices. On the other hand, a framework is proposed for multi-purpose case studies in the agriculture and food industries of Pakistan to integrate capabilities of CE and CE driven by AI. The outcomes of this research reveal that the true value of AI lies in the transition of CE and recommends that Pakistan must take some crucial measures to boost these practices to achieve sustainable development goals. Some limitations and future research proposals are also provided. The study helps researchers, companies and institues to participate positively towards the Circular Economy goal achievement by imlementing the AI.},

ABSTRACT = {Software verification is an important approach to establishing the reliability of critical systems. One important area of application is in the field of robotics, as robots take on more tasks in both day-to-day areas and highly specialised domains. Our particular interest is in checking the plans that robots are expected to follow to detect errors that would lead to unreliable behaviour. Python is a popular programming language in the robotics domain through the use of the Robot Operating System (ROS) and various other libraries. Python’s Turtle package provides a mobile agent, which we formally model here using Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). Our interactive toolchain CSP2Turtle with CSP models and Python components enables plans for the turtle agent to be verified using the FDR model-checker before being executed in Python. This means that certain classes of errors can be avoided, providing a starting point for more detailed verification of Turtle programs and more complex robotic systems. We illustrate our approach with examples of robot navigation and obstacle avoidance in a 2D grid-world. We evaluate our approach and discuss future work, including how our approach could be scaled to larger systems.},

abstract = {Introduction: While high quality leadership is of great importance for enhancing safety behavior in the workplace, there has been a lack of research on how benevolent leadership influences such behavior. Subordinates’ moqi (i.e., their unspoken understanding of the work expectations, intentions, and requirements of their superiors) and safety climate were introduced to examine this relationship. Method: Based on implicit followership theory, this study explores the relationship between benevolent (well meaning, kindly) leadership and employees' safety behavior, as well as the mediating role of subordinates' moqi and the moderating role of safety climate. 608 employees of a petroleum company in China were randomly selected as participants, and the data were collected in two stages. Results: The results showed that: (1) Benevolent leadership is positively correlated with employees' safety behavior. (2) Subordinates' moqi mediates between benevolent leadership and employees' safety behavior. (3) Safety climate moderates the mediating role of subordinates' moqi between benevolent leadership and employees' safety behavior. (4) The positive effect of subordinates' moqi on employees' safety behavior is enhanced under a positive safety climate. Conclusions: Benevolent leadership is an effective leadership style that enhances employees’ safety behaviors by promoting a moqi state between supervisors and subordinates. The invisible environmental climate, in particular, the safety climate, should be a key focus in the promotion of safety behaviors. Practical Applications: This study further broadens the research perspective of employee safety behavior from the perspective of implicit followership theory. It also provides practical guidance for improving employee safety behavior, namely selecting and cultivating benevolent leaders, enhancing subordinates' moqi, and actively fostering a positive organizational safety climate.}

abstract = {We repeat the derivation of the forces of a single-beam gradient laser trap on a dielectric sphere in the ray optics regime as first reported by Ashkin; in this case, however, we investigate the impact of partial absorption of light by the sphere on these trapping forces. Our model indicates that the effect of absorption is to reduce the axial and transverse trapping forces as a function of absorption, as well as changing the axial trap position. The trap stiffness is predicted to remain relatively unchanged even for high levels of absorption. The model also predicts that a rotational force is imparted on the sphere as a consequence of absorption. The torque associated with a single ray is first derived, which is shown to increase as a function of both absorption, radius, and the angle of incidence. This enables a derivation of the torque acting on a trapped sphere as it is laterally displaced from the trapping position, which is found to increase linearly with respect to the transverse displacement of the sphere. The torque is derived to be zero for the case of no absorption, and also for the case of axial displacement of the sphere, regardless of absorption. The model reduces exactly to Ashkin's model for the case of zero absorption.}

This tool is designed for verifying UML class diagrams annotated with large number of OCL invariants. QMaxUSE is easy to install and deploy. It offers two distinct features.

abstract = {Biodiversity is a key indicator of ecosystem health and plays an important role in providing ecosystem services that are essential for economic development and social well-being. In Ireland, climate change and anthropogenic pressures have led to biodiversity loss and habitat degradation, which in turn affects the provision of ecosystem services. The aim of this study was to determine how marine coastal biodiversity and ecosystem services in the Republic of Ireland are portrayed in the scientific literature, news media, and current legislation in order to identify knowledge gaps and priority areas of intervention for policymakers and other decision-making stakeholders. A review of the scientific literature based on the Scopus database suggests a lack of stakeholder involvement in the scientific-based approach. Up to 2022 research on marine coastal biodiversity focused primarily on species richness and diversity, especially in the context of climate change, while research on ecosystem services focused primarily on ecosystem function. Analysis of the news media found that coverage of biodiversity and ecosystem services has increased over the past decade, but opportunities are being missed to raise public awareness of the multiple benefits, not just economic, of marine coastal ecosystems, their biodiversity, and the services they provide. The terms “biodiversity” and “ecosystem services” have only been introduced into Irish legislation in recent years. The legislative context at the national level is rather fragmented at diverse levels and mainly corresponds to the transposition of European Directives while national specific legislation is less developed. The interconnection between these three domains: scientific, news media and legislative was not evident in this study, especially in the case of the scientific field. Efforts to promote science-based knowledge, communication, collaboration, and transparency between these domains are crucial to support informed decision-making and promote public engagement while conserving biodiversity. Addressing the information gaps identified in this work could help advance the implementation of Nature-based Solutions (NbS), key cost-effective measures to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change while protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services.}

abstract = {Machine learning has rapidly evolved during the last decade, achieving expert human performance on notoriously challenging problems such as image classification. This success is partly due to the re-emergence of bio-inspired modern artificial neural networks (ANNs) along with the availability of computation power, vast labelled data and ingenious human-based expert knowledge as well as optimisation approaches that can find the correct configuration (and weights) for these networks. Neuroevolution is a term used for the latter when employing evolutionary algorithms. Most of the works in neuroevolution have focused their attention in a single type of ANNs, named Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Moreover, most of these works have used a single optimisation approach. This work makes a progressive step forward in neuroevolution for vehicle trajectory prediction, referred to as neurotrajectory prediction, where multiple objectives must be considered. To this end, rich ANNs composed of CNNs and Long-short Term Memory Network are adopted. Two well-known and robust Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimisation (EMO) algorithms, named Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) are also adopted. The completely different underlying mechanism of each of these algorithms sheds light on the implications of using one over the other EMO approach in neurotrajectory prediction. In particular, the importance of considering objective scaling is highlighted, finding that MOEA/D can be more adept at focusing on specific objectives whereas, NSGA-II tends to be more invariant to objective scaling. Additionally, certain objectives are shown to be either beneficial or detrimental to finding valid models, for instance, inclusion of a distance feedback objective was considerably detrimental to finding valid models, while a lateral velocity objective was more beneficial.}

A complex event is inferred from patterns of different individual primitive events according to their spatio-temporal information. Complex event processing (CEP) systems facilitate applications to define their reasoning rules based on event processing languages (EPL), similar to SQL. However, current languages and CEP engines do not efficiently support spatial data characteristics. Geospatial CEP is challenging since applications have diverse definitions for complex events (e.g., air quality index), IoT devices have heterogeneous specifications/capabilities, and complex events may happen concurrently. This paper proposes the Geo-Tesla language that enables smart city applications to define spatial attributes in complex event definitions and reasoning rules. Then, we devise the GeoT-Rex CEP engine that implements geospatial operations that compiles Geo-Tesla language and processes the spatial data. The integration of Geo-Tesla and GeoT-Rex enables applications to process complex events with spatial characteristics in their reasoning rules and identify boundaries of the detected complex event (event footprint). The evaluation results from the proof of concept implementation show that our proposed solution outperforms in identifying the footprint of complex events up to 44% in the largest network size. They also show that the detection percentage in the concurrent appearance of complex events is 40% more on average than a close state-of-the-art baseline.}

ABSTRACT = {The world’s current linear economic model is unsustainable. This model encourages improper use of limited natural resources and causes abundant waste production resulting in severe harm to the environment. A circular economy (CE) is a sustainable, restorative, and regenerative alternative to the current linear economy and is gaining popularity worldwide. Amongst various digital technologies, Artificial intelligence (AI) is a crucial enabler for CE and can aid significantly with the adoption and implementation of CE in real-world applications. In this paper, we describe the intersection of AI and CE and policies around implementing CE principles using AI. As a means of grounding the discussion, we discuss some initiatives taken by the Irish government to adopt circularity and explore the role AI plays in these. We present a number of practical examples of AI and CE from Ireland. We argue that digitalisation has potential in CE and it has a major role to play in the transition towards CE. We close the paper by reflecting on future steps around practical implementations of AI-based CE processes.},

abstract={Global research is showing that coastal blue carbon ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change driven threats including accelerated sea-level rise and prolonged periods of drought. Furthermore, direct anthropogenic impacts present immediate threats through deterioration of coastal water quality, land reclamation, long-term impact to sediment biogeochemical cycling. These threats will invariably alter the future efficacy of carbon (C) sequestration processes and it is imperative that currently existing blue carbon habitats be protected. Knowledge of underlying biogeochemical, physical and hydrological interactions occurring in functioning blue carbon habitats is essential for developing strategies to mitigate threats, and promote conditions to optimise C sequestration/storage. In this current work, we investigated how sediment geochemistry (0–10 cm depth) responds to elevation, an edaphic factor driven by long-term hydrological regimes consequently exerting control over particle sedimentation rates and vegetation succession. },
