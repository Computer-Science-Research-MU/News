abstract="Third-wave HCI broadens technology from traditional settings to everyday life. This wave has also influenced the internet of musical things (IoMusT) and ubiquitous music (ubimus), and these fields are inspired by the idea of including everyday things to act as musical things and become part of the push for ubiquitous computing for musical activities. This multiplies the possibilities in which musical interactions can occur and thus allows participants with various levels of musical experience to engage in musical activities. The interface design that not only supports musical activities but also delivers the experience of the musical activity is a challenging task for IoMusT. This paper presents a gesture-based timbre-led musical interface designed for casual musical activities. Earlier studies with this interface have shown the social aspect of interpersonal interactions in a musical activity. As music has a social role when individuals are connected in a musical activity, it is vital to understand the patterns of these interpersonal interactions. Here, we present a qualitative study that explores this social bond and how individuals perceive their own abilities and participation during such activities. The individual and dyadic musical interactions were structured into two steps and the results are explained to discuss the dimensions of this interaction.",
