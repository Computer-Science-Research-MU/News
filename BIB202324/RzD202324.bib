ABSTRACT={The aerospace industry prioritises safety protocols to prevent accidents that can result in injuries, fatalities, or aircraft damage. One of the potential hazards that can occur while manoeuvring aircraft in and out of a hangar is collisions with other aircraft or buildings, which can lead to operational disruption and costly repairs. To tackle this issue, we have developed the Smart Hangar project, which aims to alert personnel of increased risks and prevent incidents from happening. The Smart Hangar project uses computer vision, LiDAR, and ultra-wideband sensors to track all objects and individuals within the hangar space. These data inputs are combined to form a real-time 3D Digital Twin (DT) of the hangar environment. The Active Safety system then uses the DT to perform real-time path planning, collision prediction, and safety alerts for tow truck drivers and hangar personnel. This paper provides a detailed overview of the system architecture, including the technologies used, and highlights the system's performance. By implementing this system, we aim to reduce the risk of accidents in the aerospace industry and increase safety for all personnel involved.
 Additionally, we identify future research directions for the Smart Hangar project.}

abstract  =  {Deep learning based pipelines for semantic segmentation often ignore structural information available 
on annotated images used for training. We propose a novel post-processing module enforcing structural knowledge about
 the objects of interest to improve segmentation results provided by deep neural networks (DNNs). This module corresponds
  to a “many-to-one-or-none” inexact graph matching approach, and is formulated as a quadratic assignment problem.
   Our approach is compared to a DNN-based segmentation on two public datasets, one for face segmentation from 2D RGB images
    (FASSEG), and the other for brain segmentation from 3D MRIs (IBSR). Evaluations are performed using two types of structural information: 
    distances and directional relations that are user defined, this choice being a hyper-parameter of our proposed generic framework. 
    On FASSEG data, results show that our module improves accuracy of the DNN by about 6.3\% 
    i.e. the Hausdorff distance (HD) decreases from 22.11 to 20.71 on average. With IBSR data, the improvement is of 51\% 
    better accuracy with HD decreasing from 11.01 to 5.4. Finally, our approach is shown to be resilient to small training 
    datasets that often limit the performance of deep learning methods: the improvement increases as the size of the training dataset decreases.}
